Hii! Im Xitlaly! I am a sophomore studing computer science at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
I have been into computer science since about 7th grade. I started with web development but I realized
I prefer more back end stuff. I hope to one day be a software engineer but for now I love making random
projects whenever I can!
